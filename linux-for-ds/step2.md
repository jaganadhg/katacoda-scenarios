Now let's navigate into a directory and return.

## Task
To navigate to a directory, the command is 'cd.' It stands for change directory. 
Try the command below to change to 'my_dir'

`cd my_dir`{{execute}}

To check the current location/directory, we can use the command 'pwd.' The command pwd stands as an abbreviation for the present working directory.

Let's see where we are!

`pwd`{{execute}}

To navigate back to the previous directory, we can use the command given below.

`cd ..`{{execute}}

Let's verify the action by issuing pwd command

`pwd`{{execute}}

In the previous command .. stands in the prior working directory.
